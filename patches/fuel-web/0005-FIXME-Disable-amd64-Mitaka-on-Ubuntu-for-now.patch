Subject: [PATCH] FIXME: Disable amd64 Mitaka on Ubuntu for now.

Until we fix all cohabitation of amd64 and arm64, disable Openstack
releases <Mitaka on Ubuntu 14.04> and <Mitaka on Ubuntu+UCA 14.04>
(both x86_64) in openstack.yaml fixture.

TODO: Propose renaming above releases to include arch in name.
