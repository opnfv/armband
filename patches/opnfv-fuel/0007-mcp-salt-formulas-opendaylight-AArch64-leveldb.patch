Subject: [PATCH] mcp: salt-formulas: opendaylight: AArch64 leveldb

ODL requires native leveldbjni support on architectures like AArch64.
Armband provides a Debian package that provides exactly that,
specially tailored to be applied on top of upstream Opendaylight
Debian package.

Install <armband-odl-leveldb-fix> as part of the existing Opendaylight
salt-formula (and not as part of Armband's separate salt-formula, like
previous fixups).

Some dependencies are not self-contained in this formula yet, and
should be handled before upstreaming this patch:
- Armband DEB repository (mcp-repos) is added by "openstack" state;
- only Debian systems are supported (no equivalent RPM provided);
- only systemd is supported (unlikely to change);

JIRA: https://jira.opnfv.org/browse/ARMBAND-283
