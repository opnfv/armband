Subject: [PATCH] Add cobbler-grub-aarch64 to cobbler dependencies.

The aarch64 grub EFI loader, packaged as an RPM and previously
installed in the nailgun docker container in /var/lib/cobbler,
is now added as a cobbler dependency in puppet and installed
on the Fuel master node.

[Alexandru.Avadanii@enea.com]
Reworked based on Florin's work for the docker container.
