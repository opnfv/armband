      "message": "I am confused :P\n\nThe deploy.sh I believe was moved in the fuel project which explains why some variables are removed.\n\nBut I cant find where the states for maas are applied\n\nFor example this \nsalt -C \u0027mas01*\u0027 state.apply maas.pxe_nat contains a part which enables ip forwarding which was zero on maas which is not correct IMO.\n\nHowever I do not understand how the compute nodes were commissioned in the first place :P",

      "message": "deploy.sh was not moved, it just got some minor updates, including changing 192.168.10.3 to 10.20.0.3.\nWith that in place, and Salt master being at 10.20.0.2, we no longer need to override the MAAS_IP (Armband used to chagne it from 192.168.10.3 to 192.168.10.2 to align with its public IP, 10.0.8.2, which is forced upon us by OOB (IPMI) IPs being at 10.0.8.3...).\nSo this patch merely removes another Armband divergent change, and aligns with upstream Fuel@OPNFV.\nip forwarding is 0 by default on Ubuntu, and we need 1 to allow NAT-ing between mcpcontrol and MaaS PXE.",
