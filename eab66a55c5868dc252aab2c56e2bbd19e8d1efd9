      "message": ":) the reason you got different sized hashes here (and in all other patch files in Armband) is that git 2.x (or newer, I don\u0027t recall from the top of my head) extended the short SHA string from 7 chars to 8 chars.\nTo prevent this, you should upgrade your git package on the machine used for `make patches-export` (I used a PPA on Ubuntu to do that, as the one in their main repos is too old).",
