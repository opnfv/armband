OPNFV Fuel Release Notes

Abstract
========

Armband project aims to integrate and test all aspects of OPNFV releases
on ARM-based servers. The goal is to replicate all OPNFV software build,
continuous integration, lab provisioning, and testing processes of each
standard release OPNFV, such that the release can be available on both
Intel Architecture-based and ARM Architecture-based servers.

Currently the installer supported on ``aarch64`` is OPNFV Fuel. For more
information on Fuel release notes check `OPNFV Fuel Release Notes on RTD`_.
