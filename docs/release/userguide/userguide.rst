Abstract
========

Armband project aims to integrate and test all aspects of OPNFV releases
on ARM-based servers. The goal is to replicate all OPNFV software build,
continuous integration, lab provisioning, and testing processes of each
standard release OPNFV, such that the release can be available on both
Intel Architecture-based and ARM Architecture-based servers.

The armband repo contains the patches necessary for Fuel installer to run on
aarch64 hardware. For more information on how to use Fuel@OPNFV - Fraser
release - after it was deployed check
